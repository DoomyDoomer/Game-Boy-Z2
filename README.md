Game Boy Zero Rear Button Housing

![GBZ2](IMAGES/gbzv2_03.jpg)

I created this design to add comfortable shoulder and trigger buttons to my Kiteâ€™s Circuit Sword Game Boy Zero build.

You can have the PCBs and Shell made at your favorite fabricator like JLCPCB or PCBway. This project is provided as-is, so please do the required research for having the PCB button board and shell files made.
